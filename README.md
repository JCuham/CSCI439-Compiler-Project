CSCI 439 FINAL PROJECT (C Minus Minus)

# cmm.exe

The objective of this program is to create a compiler to compile code from a made up language I
have dubbed C-- to x86 assembly using lex and yacc for parsing and tokenization as well as
C code for translation, symbol table and syntax tree building.

## Technologies

   ## Languages
	C
	BASH (makefile)
	LEX (tokenizer)
	YACC (parsing)

   ## C LIBRARIES
   <stdio.h>
   <string.h>
   <stdlib.h>
   <ctype.h>
   "y.tab.h"
   "lex.yy.c"

   ## FILES
   lexer.lex
   parser.yacc
   makefile
   
   ProjectProposal.pdf
   README

   ## Test files
   testprog.txt (test program to be compiled when make-run is entered)
   testloop.txt (simple loop test)
   testsbad/badprog1 (undeclared variable test)
   testsbad/keywordvar (using keyword as variable test)
   testsbad/multdecl (multiple declaration test)

## Build, Installation and Running the executable
   1) Type make to build the executible
   2) Type make-run to run the executible on testprog.txt
   3) Type make clean to clear the executible and associated output file

  ## Making your own programs
   1) To build the executible type "make"
   2) type ./cmm < "your_program.txt"
   This will run the CMM compiler on "your_program.txt" and compile your code to x86 assembly, if you want to compile your
   code with error checking simply type ./cmm < testsbad/"your_program.txt"

   ## Compiler Tests
   1) To build the executible type "make"
   2) type ./cmm < testsbad/...
   This will run the compiler on programs with syntax/logical errors from the "testsbad" directory. These programs demonstrate the error handling capabilities of the compiler.

## Known Issues and Bugs

   Currently the only error checking that is working is checking for undeclared variables.
   Using a keyword as a variable name results in error as expected but the error is being
   generated by the lexer rule for unrecognized input instead of a custom rule.

   I was having trouble finding good documentation on x86 scanning so currently scan statements
   are unimplemented. BOOL types are untested and code generation for bool types are currently not implemented.

   There is also an issue with the parsing as statements in scope of a for loop or if statement
   are generated twice in assembly and sometimes with the wrong label number. I will either need to add a element 
   to each tree node to keep track of the current scope and change my generate code functions to
   generate based on scope, Or make separate code generation functions for statements within loop and
   if statement scope and general code block statements.
